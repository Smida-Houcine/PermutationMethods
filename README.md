# PermutationMethods
A collection of EViews programming methods for permutation generation.  
**Description:**   
This repository provides **PermutationMethods.prg**, an EViews program implementing a collection of algorithms for permutation generation.         
**Requirements:**  
• EViews version: Implemented in EViews 13 and tested in EViews 10.   
• Operating System: Windows 10/11.  
**Files:**  
This repository is composed by the files:   
• PermutationMethods.prg: Main source code.    
• LICENSE: License file.   
• README.md: Readme file.       
• PermutationMethods.aipz: Add-in Installer.   
## Note
The "PermutationMethods.aipz" file is **optional**. To study, modify, or extend the algorithm, it is recommended to use "**PermutationMethods.prg**".  
## For Developers / Researchers:
1. Copy "PermutationMethods.prg" into EViews.
2. Run the file to use or modify the algorithm directly.
## For Experienced Users: 
The Add-in "PermutationMethods.aipz" is provided as a compressed **.aipz** file for direct installation within EViews. It is also downloadable from: http://www.eviews.com/Addins/permutationmethods.aipz    
**Installation:**  
To install the Add-in, simply run the **.aipz** installer and follow the on-screen instructions within EViews.  
**Usage:**  
Once installed, the Add-in **appears** in the EViews Add-ins menu as “**Permutation Generation Methods**”.
